# markdown-previewer
You can type markdown code in a box and it will appear on a preview screen.  
  
## Front End Libraries Projects - Build a Markdown Previewer  
**Objective:** Build a CodePen.io app that fulfills the below user stories and get all of the tests to pass. Give it your own personal style.   
  
**User Story #1:** I can see a textarea element with a corresponding id="editor".  
**User Story #2:** I can see an element with a corresponding id="preview".  
**User Story #3:** When I enter text into the #editor element, the #preview element is updated as I type to display the content of the textarea.  
**User Story #4:** When I enter GitHub flavored markdown into the #editor element, the text is rendered as HTML in the #preview element as I type (HINT: You don't need to parse Markdown yourself - you can import the Marked library for this: https://cdnjs.com/libraries/marked).  
**User Story #5:** When my markdown previewer first loads, the default text in the #editor field should contain valid markdown that represents at least one of each of the following elements: a header (H1 size), a sub header (H2 size), a link, inline code, a code block, a list item, a blockquote, an image, and bolded text.  
**User Story #6:** When my markdown previewer first loads, the default markdown in the #editor field should be rendered as HTML in the #preview element.  
  
**Optional Bonus (you do not need to make this test pass):** When I click a link rendered by my markdown previewer, the link is opened up in a new tab (HINT: read the Marked.js docs for this one!).  
**Optional Bonus (you do not need to make this test pass):** My markdown previewer interprets carriage returns and renders them as br (line break) elements.  
You can build your project by forking this CodePen pen. Or you can use this CDN link to run the tests in any environment you like: https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/testable-projects-fcc/v1/bundle.js  
Once you're done, submit the URL to your working project with all its tests passing.  
Remember to use the ***Read-Search-Ask*** method if you get stuck.
